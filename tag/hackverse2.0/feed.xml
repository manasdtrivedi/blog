      <content type="html" xml:base="/blog/hackverse-tracks">&lt;p&gt;The HackVerse 2.0 mascot, Cody will be briefing you on the tracks of HackVerse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings, skipper! Welcome to the starboard of the HackVerse submarine! Today we shall be charting out the itinerary of your underwater voyage. You and your crewmates must use one of the following currents of the Arabian Sea to arrive at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/hackverse-tracks/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nitk beach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-1-lets-have-fun&quot;&gt;Track 1: Let’s Have Fun!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, there’s been quite a bit of boredom among us. The forces of gaming and coding must combine and speedrun through creating the ultimate entertainment application. Only then shall humanity be freed from the dungeons of dullness, and released into the land of leisure and excitement…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this track, create or modify a piece of software dedicated to entertainment and fun. This would include things like building a new video game, reviving abandonware games by adding new features, and creating any fun application containing audio and/or video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather ambitious instance of such a software would be an application which listens to a person singing, identifies the song, and plays the corresponding karaoke track matching the tempo of the singer in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-2-lets-connect&quot;&gt;Track 2: Let’s Connect!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying connected online in the Era of the Lockdown has perhaps been the only thing keeping us going. Almost all forms of social interaction have been ported online, whether it’s Work From Home, online classes, or virtual freshers parties!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/hackverse-tracks/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lets connect pawri meme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along this track, you’d be building a solution which acts as an online substitute for a conventionally offline social gathering or interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specimen of such a hack could be a dedicated alumni reunion application. Guess it’s about time I reconnected with my long-lost buccaneers from diving school!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-3-lets-stay-fit&quot;&gt;Track 3: Let’s Stay Fit!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a scuba diver, I must maintain my fitness at all times to explore the depths of the ocean. To keep a tab on my fitness levels, I’ve filled up my smart goggles to the brim with apps which monitor my daily activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to follow this track, you’d be creating a solution which shall help your fellow humans (and my fellow divers!) in maintaining their health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An idea for a solution in this field could be an application which intelligently suggests a workout routine based on the health and fitness of the user. Gotta hustle for that muscle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-4-lets-go-contactless&quot;&gt;Track 4: Let’s Go Contactless!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, there were certain things which conventionally required human interaction. But thanks to the work of countless hackers across the globe, we now have contactless alternatives for dozens of things which required physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from this community, build a solution which embraces the idea of going contactless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instance for such a solution would be building a truly contactless biometric system, which replaces traditional fingerprint authentication. You could also perhaps build a contactless steering system for your submarine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-5-lets-stay-safe&quot;&gt;Track 5: Let’s Stay Safe!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defend your submarine against the Trojan Seahorse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this track, you’d be building a cybersecurity solution for securing a computer, server, electronic system, network, data, or similar from malicious attacks carried out by black hat seahorses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/hackverse-tracks/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hackerman meme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible solution in this domain would be to create a secure chat application. Sounds like unchartered territory? Check out this Make With HackVerse tutorial to build one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-6-lets-innovate&quot;&gt;Track 6: Let’s Innovate!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother of humankind’s most important abilities, innovation has impacted essentially all domains of our life, whether it’s pulling off emergency all-nighters under an LED bulb, conserving fossil fuels by using electric cars, or viewing this blog post on a smartphone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This track represents the boundlessness of the ocean. The grounds (or &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; the seas) are open for innovation. Come up with any innovative hack that could make your everyday life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/hackverse-tracks/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bill gates meme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of making life easier during the age of online classes, an instance of an innovative solution could perhaps be building an MS Teams Auto-Attender!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

You have opened this message.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate the treacherous waters
of the Arabian sea until you get to the HackVerse 2.0 submarine.
Once you’re in there, you’re safe.

--- Message transmission terminated.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HackVerse 2.0 mascot, Cody will guide you on your journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello HackVerse aspirants!
I’m Cody, your favourite underwater mascot and I’m here to help you out on your exciting underwater voyage, from the dock of registration to the starboard of results. Hold your breath…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkpoint-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHECKPOINT 1:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dock-of-registration&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THE DOCK OF REGISTRATION&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
To participate, form a team of 2 to 3 people.
Can’t find teammates? Don’t worry, you can still register individually, and find other participants who have also individually registered later on to team up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each aspirant, whether a member of a team or not, has to fill in the application form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;READY OR NOT? DIVE IN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkpoint-2-&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHECKPOINT 2 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-acquainted-with-a-deep-sea-creature-the-application-form&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET ACQUAINTED WITH A DEEP SEA CREATURE, THE APPLICATION FORM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/&quot;&gt;HackVerse Website&lt;/a&gt;, and click the ‘Apply with Devfolio’ button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/explorers-guide-to-hackverse/website.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HackVerse 2.0 website&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will then be directed to create an account/login on Devfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon signing up/logging in, you will be directed to the HackVerse dashboard on Devfolio. Click ‘Continue to the application’ to go to the HackVerse application form. This application is what will be reviewed by the HackVerse team for the initial filtering of participants, so do fill it carefully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/explorers-guide-to-hackverse/devfolio.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Application Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two sections of the application, one occupying the top half of the page, the other, the bottom. The first section pertains to the necessary paperwork - things required by us, from you, formally. There are five subsections in this section - About, Education, Experience, Links, and Contact. You can move to the next subsection only after completing the current subsection by clicking the ‘Next: &amp;lt;subsection&amp;gt;’ button. You can move back to a previous subsection any time by clicking the ‘Previous: &amp;lt;subsection&amp;gt;’ button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/explorers-guide-to-hackverse/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Step-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkpoint-3-&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHECKPOINT 3 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;youre-nearing-your-destination-flap-your-flippers-and-dive-deeper&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YOU’RE NEARING YOUR DESTINATION! FLAP YOUR FLIPPERS AND DIVE DEEPER...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Once you’ve completed the first section, move to the second section - the one where you give us an idea of your hacking expertise. Upon filling the fields in this section, tick the checkboxes at the bottom of the page to complete the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/explorers-guide-to-hackverse/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Step-2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/explorers-guide-to-hackverse/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Step-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, there are two roads to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re applying as a team, click the ‘Join or create team’ button. One of the team members would be required to create a team by providing a team name, and would then obtain a team code. The other team members would use this code to join the team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re applying individually (and form a team with other individual participants later on), click the ‘Submit individual application’ button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/explorers-guide-to-hackverse/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Step-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AH! THERE IT IS! THE ELUSIVE SUBMARINE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;--- You have successfully completed your mission. Wait for further instructions ---&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkpoint-4-&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHECKPOINT 4 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enjoy-the-view-from-the-starboard&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ENJOY THE VIEW FROM THE STARBOARD!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The procedure of filtering applications will begin in a couple of weeks after the applications start rolling in. If you’re shortlisted for the hackathon, you will receive an email stating the good news from Devfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days before the hackathon, a Discord server will be created, where you and the other shortlisted participants will be added. Here is where the fun starts - workshops, talks from eminent industry experts, and other fascinating events. During these interactions, participants who have registered individually would be required to team up with other individual registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkpoint-5-&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHECKPOINT 5 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;date-27th-february-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DATE: 27TH FEBRUARY 2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hackverse-20-submarine-is-loaded-and-ready-to-explore-the-unseen&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THE HACKVERSE 2.0 SUBMARINE IS LOADED AND READY TO EXPLORE THE UNSEEN...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
You and your team will battle it out with the other teams in a race to create the most unique hack. Leaders in the industry will be among those present to judge each team’s submission. Submissions will be open to the community, for promoting the ideas of impartiality and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkpoint-6-&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHECKPOINT 6 :&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;date-28th-february-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DATE: 28TH FEBRUARY 2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-thus-the-last-unexplored-frontier-on-earth-was-conquered&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;..AND THUS, THE LAST UNEXPLORED FRONTIER ON EARTH WAS CONQUERED.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Results will be announced a few days after the hackathon, followed by the Prize distribution ceremony and Hackerman felicitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncovering the secrets of the deep sea is no small task, and we hope that you will persevere until the end. Never stop dreaming; never stop exploring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT’S TIME TO RISE TO THE SURFACE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
